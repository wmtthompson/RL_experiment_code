# Brainstorm

Here are some ideas so far. Here is some markdown code that can be used to represent the classes that I am interested in fleshing out.

```sql
@startuml
StateValueTable o-- StateList 
StateList o-- State 
@enduml
```

The StateValueTable would stay as it is mostly, but would be designed to take in a class called something like StateList, which would contain a list of states. 

StatesList would be able to produce a return of a specific state which should be a unique hash? In other words you need to be able to lookup a state and lookup its value in the value table.

yeah somehow these states need to be used by the StateValueTable to lookup a particular value that goes with a particular state. In other words a state can be put into the data structure as a key and the value is the value that goes with that particular state. The state looked up should have a unique index or hash. 

The state class should have an enum in it, so that when indexing an individual state object, the index goes to the enum. the state class should also provide a way to represent the states in a string or something like that. 

THen there is a State class that could contain info about a particular event and inherits the abstract state class. 

StateList class should probably be based on an abstract class as well so that a test version of the class can be made to do the job.

## Some other ideas from AI

It sounds like you're looking to create a generic framework for managing and tracking the states of your equipment testing application. Here are some ideas for classes that might help encapsulate these states:

1. ConnectionState class: This class would represent the connection state between the serial communication and the equipment being tested. It could have properties such as "isConnected" and "responseReceived", and methods to send commands and check for responses.
2. CommandState class: This class would represent the available and valid commands that can be sent to the equipment, along with their expected response. It could have a list of command names and associated data structures or functions to handle each command's execution.
3. EquipmentState class: This class would represent the current state of the equipment being tested, such as whether it is in a ready state or maintenance mode, and any test results that have been collected. It could also have methods for running tests and collecting data.
4. ErrorState class: This class would handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during operation, such as lost connections or responses outside of normal parameters. It could log these events and trigger appropriate error handling mechanisms in the application.
5. StateSpace class: This class would take in instances of the ConnectionState, CommandState, EquipmentState, and ErrorState classes, and create a flattened state space that can be indexed with a single integer. It could also have methods for printing out summaries of the various state spaces.
6. ValueEstimation class: This class would provide estimated values for each state in the state space based on certain criteria or formulas. For example, it might estimate the likelihood of success for a particular test based on historical data or other factors.

These are just some ideas to get you started. Depending on your specific requirements and the complexity of your application, you may need to modify these classes or create additional ones to handle more specialized functionality.

Here is something like what I was thinking, but this probably would need to be modified.

```CPP
template<typename T>   // Create a generic class that works with any type T
class State {
public:
    // Constructor
    State(int num_states) {
        states = new std::vector<std::vector<T>>(num_states);
    }

    // Add a state to the state space
    void add_state(unsigned state, T state_data) {
        states[state].push_back(state_data);
    }

    // Remove a state from the state space
    void remove_state(unsigned state) {
        states[state].erase(states[state].begin() + 1, states[state].end());
    }

    // Get the number of states
    unsigned get_num_states() const {
        return states->size();
    }

    // Printing the current state space
    void print_states() {
        for (int i = 0; i < num_states; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < states[i].size(); j++) {
                std::cout << "State [" << i << "][" << j << "] = " << states[i][j] << std::endl;
            }
        }
    }

private:
    // Vector of vectors to store all the states
    std::vector<std::vector<T>>* states;
};
```

Your template class looks like a good starting point for creating a generic framework for managing and tracking the states in your equipment testing application. Here are some suggestions for modifications:

1. Add type constraints to the template parameter T to ensure that it is a valid data type for storing state information. For example, you might want to restrict T to be one of std::string, int, or double.
2. Consider adding additional methods to handle common operations on the state space, such as checking if a particular state exists, finding the index of a given state, and iterating over all states in the space.
3. To make it easier to use your class with different types of equipment and test scenarios, you might want to consider creating separate classes for each type of equipment or scenario that inherit from your State template class. This would allow you to define specialized properties and methods for each type without having to modify the base class.
4. You may also want to add support for handling errors and exceptions in your application by adding an ErrorState class as described earlier, and integrating it with your State classes.
5. To make it easier to print out summaries of the various state spaces, you might consider creating a separate Printable interface that defines methods for printing out the current state space, and have your State classes implement this interface. This would allow you to use a single printer object to print out the state spaces from any type of equipment or scenario.

Overall, these are just some suggestions for modifying your template class to better suit your needs. Depending on the specific requirements of your application, you may need to make additional changes or create additional classes to handle more specialized functionality.
